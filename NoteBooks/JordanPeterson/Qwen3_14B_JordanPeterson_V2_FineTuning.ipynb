    "## Why Version 1 Underperformed — A Detailed Post-Mortem\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Passage-Regurgitation Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "V1 produced models that, when prompted with a question like *\"What is the\n",
    "relationship between order and chaos?\"*, responded with raw book text beginning\n",
    "mid-sentence: *\"…the world, and the dragon of chaos that guards it, is…\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a failure of fine-tuning — it is a direct consequence of what the\n",
    "training data asked the model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause 1: The Training Task Was Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "The V1 dataset was created by chunking each book into 350-word passages and\n",
    "formatting each chunk as a conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "System:    \"You are trained on Peterson's works…\"\n",
    "User:      [first half of a passage]\n",
    "Assistant: [second half of the same passage]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This teaches the model a **text-completion task**: given a piece of Peterson's\n",
    "writing, continue it.  At inference time we ask something entirely different —\n",
    "we give it a question and expect a structured, thoughtful answer.  The model\n",
    "has never seen that task during training, so it falls back on what it learned:\n",
    "produce passage-like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fix is to use **instruction-tuning format** (Q&A pairs) so the training task\n",
    "at inference matches the training task at fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause 2: One Epoch Is Not Enough\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning on a new domain goes through three identifiable phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Phase | Epochs | What the model learns |\n",
    "|-------|--------|----------------------|\n",
    "| **Memorisation** | 0.5 – 1.5 | Reproduces training examples nearly verbatim |\n",
    "| **Generalisation** | 1.5 – 3.5 | Internalises patterns; applies style to new questions |\n",
    "| **Overfitting** | 4.0+ | Vocabulary narrows; starts looping; perplexity rises |\n",
    "\n",
    "V1 stopped at 1 epoch — deep in the memorisation phase.  The model had not\n",
    "yet learned to *generalise* Peterson's voice to unseen prompts.  Three epochs\n",
    "is the community-established sweet spot for LoRA stylistic fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause 3: LoRA Rank Was Too Low\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA injects trainable low-rank matrices `B` (d×r) and `A` (r×d) into each\n",
    "attention projection.  The rank `r` determines how many independent directions\n",
    "in weight space the adapter can modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **r=16**, the adapter has 16 independent directions per projection.  For\n",
    "simple task adaptation (e.g., translating to a different language) this is\n",
    "sufficient.  For **stylistic fine-tuning** — which requires capturing\n",
    "vocabulary distribution, sentence rhythm, conceptual framing, and rhetorical\n",
    "structure simultaneously — more capacity helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**r=32** doubles the adapter parameters (still only ~0.12% of model weights)\n",

    "## V2 Improvement Strategy — Technical Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Qwen3-14B Over GPT-OSS 20B\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models were evaluated in V1.  Qwen3-14B is the better choice for V2\n",
    "for three independent reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lower training loss** (2.44 vs 3.01) — despite being a smaller model,\n",
    "   Qwen3 absorbed the domain signal more efficiently in one epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training speed** (23 min vs 73 min per epoch) — with 3 epochs planned,\n",
    "   GPT-OSS would take ~220 min; Qwen3 takes ~70 min.  Time is a limited resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Architectural recency** — Qwen3-14B (2025) is a significantly more capable\n",
    "   base model than GPT-OSS 20B for instruction-following, which matters for\n",
    "   the Q&A format we are training on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger parameter count of GPT-OSS (20B vs 14B) does not compensate for\n",
    "these disadvantages.  Bigger is not always better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Synthetic Q&A Data Is the Highest-Leverage Change\n",
    "\n",
    "The authenticity of a fine-tuned model depends on two things:\n",
    "- The **answers** must sound like the target author (Peterson)\n",
    "- The **questions** must teach the model when to activate that voice\n",
    "\n",
    "Our synthetic Q&A strategy achieves both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answers** = verbatim passages from Peterson's books — authentic, unmodified\n",
    "- **Questions** = generated by Claude Haiku from each passage — lightweight,\n",
    "  cost-efficient (~$1–3 total for all 4 books), high enough quality because\n",
    "  the questions are just triggers; the training signal is in the answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This mirrors how successful open-source instruction datasets (Alpaca, WizardLM,\n",
    "OpenHermes) were built: use a capable LLM to generate questions, use high-quality\n",
    "human text as answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Three Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical evidence from the LoRA fine-tuning literature converges on 3 epochs\n",
    "as the sweet spot for domain-specific stylistic adaptation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 epoch**: Model has seen each example once.  Gradient updates are noisy.\n",
    "  Output closely resembles training examples (regurgitation).\n",
    "- **2 epochs**: Visible improvement; model begins generalising.  Some\n",
    "  prompts still trigger passage-like output.\n",
    "- **3 epochs**: Robust generalisation across unseen prompts.  Style is\n",
    "  internalized, not just memorised.\n",
    "- **5+ epochs**: Vocabulary narrows toward training set vocabulary; model\n",
    "  starts to lose general coherence on out-of-distribution prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why r=32 and alpha=32\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA replaces a weight update `ΔW` with `(alpha/rank) * B*A` where `B` is\n",
    "`(d_model × r)` and `A` is `(r × d_model)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `alpha = rank` (as in V1 with `r=16, alpha=16`, and V2 with `r=32,\n",
    "alpha=32`) keeps the effective scale factor at `alpha/rank = 1.0`.  This means\n",
    "the LoRA update is applied at the same relative strength as the base weights,\n",
    "which is the established baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doubling the rank from 16 to 32 doubles the *capacity* of the adapter (number\n",
    "of directions it can modify) without changing the *strength* of updates.  This\n",
    "is the conservative, well-grounded improvement: more representational power,\n",
    "same learning dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why gradient_accumulation_steps=4 (unchanged)\n",
    "\n",
    "With `per_device_train_batch_size=2` and `gradient_accumulation_steps=4`,\n",
    "the effective batch size is **8 examples** per gradient update.  This was\n",
    "already correct in V1 — Qwen3-14B fits 2 examples per forward pass on the\n",
    "4090, and 4 accumulation steps gives stability without excessive memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "No change needed here.\n",

    "We will:\n",
    "1. Extract all passages from the four Peterson PDFs (same extraction logic as V1)\n",

    "   passage directly answers\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Cost**: Haiku is the most affordable Claude model (~$0.80/M input tokens,\n",
    "  $4.00/M output tokens).  Generating questions for ~1,200 passages costs\n",
    "  roughly $1–3 total.\n",

    "  plausible, on-topic questions.  The *training signal* is entirely in the\n",

    "\n",
    "Low-Rank Adaptation freezes the pre-trained weight matrices `W` and injects a\n",
    "trainable update `ΔW = (alpha/r) × B × A` where:\n",
    "- `B` has shape `(d_model × r)` — initialised to zero\n",
    "- `A` has shape `(r × d_model)` — initialised with random Gaussian values\n",
    "- `r` is the rank — our key improvement from 16 → 32\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of training `B=0` so `ΔW=0` and the model behaves identically to\n",
    "the base model.  Training gradually fills `B` with the directions needed to\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why r=32 Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `r` as the number of \"stylistic dimensions\" the adapter can learn.\n",
    "With r=16, the adapter has 16 orthogonal directions to encode things like:\n",
    "*\"use chaos/order vocabulary\"*, *\"frame arguments historically\"*,\n",
    "*\"connect psychology to mythology\"*, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "With r=32 we have 32 such dimensions — enough to capture both the macro-level\n",

    "\n",
    "### Target Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply LoRA to all attention projection matrices (q, k, v, o) and all MLP\n",
    "gate/up/down projections.  This is the full set recommended by Unsloth for\n",
