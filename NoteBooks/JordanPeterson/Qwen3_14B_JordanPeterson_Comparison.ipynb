    "# Comparing Base vs. Fine-Tuned Qwen3-14B: Jordan Peterson Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a quantitative comparison between:\n",
    "- **Base model**: `unsloth/Qwen3-14B-unsloth-bnb-4bit` — Qwen3-14B with no domain specialization\n",
    "- **Fine-tuned model**: The same base with LoRA adapters trained on ~768,000 words from four Jordan Peterson books\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the companion to `GPT_OSS_20B_JordanPeterson_Comparison.ipynb` and uses the identical evaluation framework, allowing meaningful cross-model comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Notebook Differs from the GPT-OSS Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | GPT-OSS 20B | Qwen3-14B |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Chat template | Harmony (`reasoning_effort`) | **ChatML** (`enable_thinking`) |\n",
    "| Inference API | `apply_chat_template(return_dict=True)` | **`apply_chat_template` → text → tokenize** |\n",
    "| Thinking mode | Via `reasoning_effort=\"low\"` | Via **`enable_thinking=False`** |\n",
    "| Expected base perplexity | Higher (larger model, different training) | Different baseline |\n",
    "| Fine-tune loss | 3.01 | **2.44** (better — smaller model, larger batch) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics (Same as GPT-OSS Comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | What It Measures | Expected Result |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Perplexity** | How surprised the model is by Peterson's actual writing | Fine-tuned = lower |\n",
    "| **TF-IDF Similarity** | Vocabulary overlap with real Peterson passages | Fine-tuned = higher |\n",
    "| **Keyword Density** | Frequency of Peterson's characteristic vocabulary | Fine-tuned = higher |\n",
    "| **Type-Token Ratio** | Vocabulary richness | Fine-tuned ≈ higher |\n",
    "| **Response Length** | Words per response (Peterson is verbose) | Fine-tuned = longer |\n",
    "| **Word Distribution** | Word clouds of dominant vocabulary | Fine-tuned = Peterson-specific terms |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Qwen3-14B in 4-bit uses ~10-11 GB of VRAM. We still can't fit two models simultaneously (would require ~22 GB active at once, plus overhead), so we evaluate them sequentially, caching results to disk between phases."

    "\n",
    "**Perplexity** is the most direct indicator of domain adaptation. After fine-tuning on ~768,000 words of Peterson's writing, the model should assign higher probability to his actual sentences — producing lower perplexity. The magnitude of improvement reflects how thoroughly the 14B model has internalized his patterns in a single epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF Similarity** tests whether the model's responses use Peterson's *distinctive* vocabulary — not just common words, but the specific terms (chaos, logos, archetype, sovereignty) that characterize his writing across all four books.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keyword Density** provides the most direct check: does the model use Peterson's signature words when answering his central questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type-Token Ratio** captures the richness of the model's vocabulary — a property Peterson is known for in his elaborate, multi-layered prose.\n",

    "- **One epoch**: More epochs would deepen style adoption. Three epochs typically produces noticeably more Peterson-like outputs.\n",
    "- **Greedy decoding**: Deterministic generation for fair comparison. Sampling (`temperature=0.7`, `top_p=0.8`) as recommended by Qwen3 for chat mode would likely produce richer responses.\n",
    "- **Thinking mode not tested**: We use `enable_thinking=False` throughout for a clean apples-to-apples comparison. Enabling thinking at inference might produce substantively different (and potentially better) outputs for the fine-tuned model."
